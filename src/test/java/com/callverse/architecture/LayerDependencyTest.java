/**
 * Enforces the Clean Architecture dependency rule.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this test exists.</strong> CallVerse is a single Maven module. A multi-module build
 * would have let the compiler enforce these boundaries: if {@code core} cannot see {@code host} on
 * its classpath, importing it is impossible rather than merely discouraged. A single module buys
 * simplicity at the cost of that guarantee, and this test is what buys the guarantee back. Without
 * it the layout is a naming convention, and naming conventions do not survive a deadline.
 *
 * <p>These rules fail the build, which is deliberate. A violation caught in review is caught by
 * whoever happens to be reviewing; a violation caught here is caught every time, including at
 * three in the morning before a demo.
 *
 * <p>If a rule below ever blocks legitimate work, the answer is to discuss the boundary and change
 * the rule deliberately, not to add an exclusion so the build goes green again.
