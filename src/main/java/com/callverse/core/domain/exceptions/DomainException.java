/**
 * Base type for conditions the business forbids.
 *
 * <p>A {@code DomainException} means a rule of the relation center was violated: a commercial
 * credit beyond the ceiling, a conversation routed to an advisor without the required skill, a
 * ticket transitioned to a state it cannot reach from where it is. It does not mean the request was
 * malformed or the caller was unauthorised; those are application and host concerns respectively.
 *
 * <p>Unchecked on purpose. These conditions are not recoverable at the call site: the caller cannot
 * meaningfully catch "the credit ceiling was exceeded" and try something else, so forcing every
 * intermediate method to declare it would add noise without adding a decision.
 *
 * <p>Each subclass carries a stable {@link #code()}. The code, not the message, is what clients
 * branch on: messages are for humans and will be reworded, and in this product some of them will
 * eventually be translated into French for the customer portal.
