/**
 * Codes of the reference skills seeded into the {@code skill} table.
 *
 * <p><strong>Unlike every other enum here, this one is not mapped to a column.</strong> The database
 * models skills as a table with a UUID primary key rather than as a {@code CHECK} constraint,
 * because a skill carries a label and will eventually carry routing metadata, and because an
 * operator must be able to add one without a migration.
 *
 * <p>It exists for two narrow purposes: naming the rows created by {@code V2__seed_reference.sql}
 * and re-coded by {@code V3__banking_domain.sql}, and giving application code a type-safe way to
 * look a skill up by code rather than passing a bare string. If a skill is ever added at runtime that has no constant here, that is expected and not
 * an error — which is exactly why this must never become a persisted column type.
