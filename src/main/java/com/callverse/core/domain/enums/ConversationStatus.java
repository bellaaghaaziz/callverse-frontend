/**
 * Lifecycle state of a conversation, and the only place the legal transitions between those states
 * are written down.
 *
 * <p>The state machine, reproduced from the schema reference:
 *
 * <pre>
 * QUEUED ──&gt; ASSIGNED ──&gt; ACTIVE ──&gt; RESOLVED
 *    │           │           │
 *    │           │           └──&gt; ESCALATED ──&gt; RESOLVED
 *    └───────────┴──────────────&gt; ABANDONED
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The database {@code CHECK} constraint guarantees only that the column holds one of these six
 * values. It cannot express that {@code RESOLVED → QUEUED} is nonsense, so that rule lives here,
 * with the type, rather than being reinvented in the router, the SLA sweep and the simulation
 * runner independently and inconsistently.
 *
 * <p>Consumed by {@code ConversationRules}, which every lifecycle use case goes through, and by
 * the escalation use case; an illegal transition is refused with {@code INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION}.
 *
 * <p>Persisted as {@code EnumType.STRING}, never ORDINAL. These constants must match the column's
 * SQL CHECK constraint character for character.
