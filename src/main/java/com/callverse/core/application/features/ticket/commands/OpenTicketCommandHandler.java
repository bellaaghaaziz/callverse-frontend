/**
 * Opens a ticket — formerly the agent tool {@code POST /internal/tickets}
 * ({@code OWNERSHIP_RULES.md} E5).
 *
 * <p>Serves {@code POST /api/v1/tickets} (advisors and supervisors). The AI tool that once called it was withdrawn on
 * 2026-09-30.
 *
 * <p><strong>What the backend decides, not the agent.</strong> Every new ticket is {@code OPEN};
 * the agent cannot file one already closed. Severity defaults to 3 and must be 1 to 5 — checked here
 * as well as at the HTTP edge, so another caller of this handler cannot reach the database's CHECK
 * constraint and surface as a 500. When a conversation is named, it must belong to the named
 * customer.
 *
 * <p><strong>What it cannot decide.</strong> With no conversation named, the customer id is taken on
 * the agent's word: the route carries no conversation, and no column records which conversations the
 * agent is handling. That residual trust was the scope of the withdrawn service key, recorded in E5;
 * a re-exposed route must bound it with its own role or ownership rule.
