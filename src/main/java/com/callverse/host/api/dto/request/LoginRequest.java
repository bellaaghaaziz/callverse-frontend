/**
 * Body of {@code POST /api/v1/auth/login}.
 *
 * <p>The first occupant of this package, and the first request DTO in the repository.
 *
 * <p><strong>Validation is deliberately shallow.</strong> Both fields must be present and
 * non-blank, and nothing more: no email-format check, no length or complexity rule. A stricter
 * rejection would answer a different question than the caller asked — the endpoint's only job is to
 * say whether these credentials are accepted, and a malformed address is simply not accepted. It
 * would also hand an attacker a cheap distinction between "not a real address" and "not a real
 * account".
